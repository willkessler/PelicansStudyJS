# Pelicans Study (Javascript)

An exploration of v-formation flocking in javascript and P5, liberally
copying from Daniel Schiffman.

See original Daniel Schiffman explanation of these mechanisms from
Nature of Code series,
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujsR2vcJlLk).

### Goal

The goal of this project is to move towards v-formation flocking. The
lead "bird" will be followed slightly behind and to the left and right
by follower birds.  The lead bird will "tire" and fall back, letting
other birds take the lead for a while.
